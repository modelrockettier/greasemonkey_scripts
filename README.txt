This is a collection of various GreaseMonkey scripts that I have created over
time to adapt the browsing experience to be more enjoyable for me.  I use these
scripts and that is their primary purpose, but I hope that you can find some
use out of them too.

These scripts are at differing levels of completion and as a result they may or
may not work as intended.

Use at your own risk.
